Using namespaces allows you to encapsulate classes under one scope.
It also allows you redefinition of classes in different namespaces and change logic of those classes.

Classes and structs define types. You can create an object of a type. Namespaces simply declare a scope inside which other types, functions, objects, or namespaces can exist.
You can't create an object of type std (unless of course you created a type called  std, which would hide the std namespace).
